# VHDL Practical - catch up and review 

*For week 1, we do some review and catch up.*

Some of the key labs from Semester 1 are liked below - if you have not already done these, please do so in the lab and your own time. These are important topics which underpin some of the material in following weeks.  The lab on SPI should be repeated even if you have done it before.
